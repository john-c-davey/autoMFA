\arguments{
\item{Y}{An \emph{n} by \emph{p} data matrix, where \emph{n} is the number of observations and \emph{p} is the number of dimensions of the data.}

\item{gmin}{The smallest number of components for which an MFA model will be fitted.}

\item{gmax}{The largest number of components for which an MFA model will be fitted.}

\item{eta}{The smallest possible entry in any of the error matrices \emph{D_i} \insertCite{Jian-HuaZhao2008FMEf}{autoMFA}.}

\item{itmax}{The maximum number of ECM iterations allowed for the estimation of each MFA model.}

\item{nkmeans}{The number of times the \emph{k}-means algorithm will be used to initialise models for each combination of \emph{g} and \emph{q}.}

\item{nrandom}{The number of randomly initialised models that will be used for each combination of \emph{g} and \emph{q}.}

\item{tol}{The ECM algorithm terminates if the measure of convergence falls below this value.}

\item{conv_measure}{The convergence criterion of the ECM algorithm. The default \code{'diff'} stops the ECM iterations if |l^{(k+1)} - l^{(k)}| < \code{tol} where l^{(k)} is the log-likelihood at the \emph{k}th ECM iteration. If \code{'ratio'}, then the convergence of the ECM iterations is measured using |(l^{(k+1)} - l^{(k)})/l^{(k+1)}|.}

\item{varimax}{Boolean indicating whether the output factor loading matrices should be constrained
using varimax rotation or not.}

\description{
An implementation of AMFA algorithm from \insertCite{WangWan-Lun2020Alom}{autoMFA}. The number of factors, \emph{q}, is estimated during the fitting process of each MFA model.
The best value of \emph{g} is chosen as the model with the minimum BIC of all candidate models in the range \code{gmin} <= \emph{g} <= \code{gmax}.
