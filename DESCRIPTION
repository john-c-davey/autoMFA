Description: Provides methods for fitting the Mixture of Factor Analyzers (MFA) 
    model automatically. The MFA model is a mixture model where each sub-population
    is assumed to follow the Factor Analysis (FA) model. The FA model is a latent 
    variable model which assumes that observations are normally distributed, but 
    imposes constraints on their covariance matrix. The MFA model contains two 
    hyperparameters; g (the number of components in the mixture) and q (the number
    of factors in each component Factor Analysis model). Usually, the 
    Expectation-Maximisation algorithm would be used to fit the MFA model, but this
    requires g and q to be known. This package treats g and q as unknowns and 
    provides several methods which infer these values with as little input from 
    the user as possible. The available methods are a na√Øve search over both g and 
    q, two different implementations of the AMFA algorithm (Wang and Lin, 2020)
