#' Preprocess
#'
#'@description Performs the pre-processing of a data matrix such that it is ready
#'to be used by \code{vbmfa}.
#'
#' @param Y An \emph{n} by \emph{p} data matrix which is to be scaled.
#' @param ppp An optional \emph{p} by 2 matrix where the columns represent
#' the sample mean and sample standard deviation of the \emph{p}th dimension of \code{Y}.
#' @param shrinkQ If 1, the data is shrunk according to \code{ppp}. If 0, the data is expanded
#' to invert a prior shrinking by \code{ppp}.
#'
#' @return A list containing \itemize{
#' \item{\code{Yout}:}{ A processed data matrix of observations.}
#' \item{\code{ppp}:}{ The shrinkage which as applied in the processing.}
#' }
